                                            WIRE BREAK ALARM SYSTEM
ABSTRACT:
A wire break alarm system is a crucial tool for monitoring the integrity of wired networks in various applications, including power transmission lines, fencing systems, and industrial setups. This project focuses on designing and implementing a costeffective, reliable, and easy-to-maintain system to detect wire breaks and alert the user in real-
time.The system employs a simple circuit configuration that continuously monitors the continuity of a wire loop. A low-voltage current flows through the wire, and any disruption caused by a break is immediately detected.

INTRODUCTION:
In today’s interconnected world, the reliability and integrity of wiring systems are essential across various industries, including power transmission, security, and telecommunications. A single wire break can lead to severe consequences, such as system failure, operational downtime, and potential safety hazards. This makes early detection of wire breaks a critical requirement for preventing extensive damage and ensuring smooth operation.The wire break alarm system is a practical and efficient solution designed to address this issue by providing real-time monitoring and alert mechanisms. This system is specifically engineered to detect disruptions in electrical continuity caused by a break in the wire. Upon detecting suchitra an anomaly, the system triggers an alarm, notifying the user of the fault’s occurrence and enabling immediate corrective actions. It involves continuously monitoring the electrical circuit for continuity.
